# DAIICT-AI-Summer-Projects-2024

We are excited to announce our AI Club's summer projects! This is a fantastic opportunity to delve into the world of artificial intelligence and gain hands-on experience in some of the most exciting and cutting-edge areas of AI. Whether you're a beginner or have some experience, we have a project for you. </br>

The topics of the projects are as follows:  </br>

**1. 0 to 100 Machine Learning** </br>
Ideal for beginners, this project will take you from the basics to more advanced machine-learning concepts. You'll learn how to implement your own machine-learning models and understand the theory behind them, providing a solid foundation in this crucial area of AI.  </br>


**2. NLP (Natural Language Processing)** </br>
Explore the intriguing field of NLP, where machines learn to understand and process human language. We'll cover key topics such as tokenization, sentiment analysis, and language generation. This project is perfect for those interested in how AI can interpret and generate human language. </br>


**3. Deep Learning and Computer Vision** </br>
This project focuses on deep learning and its applications in computer vision. Starting from the basics of neural networks, we will progress to more advanced topics like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image recognition. You'll gain hands-on experience in developing computer vision models and understanding deep learning complexities.
